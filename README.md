REST API using: Typescript, Expressjs, JWT, Jest, Morgan and Winstong for loggin.

Heroku ready ;)

## Running on local
In order to run your local server (and run the tests), You need to edit a `.env` file with the following variables:
```shell
PORT
MONGODB_LOCAL_URI
MONGODB_TEST_URL
USERMODEL_TESTDB_URL
SHOWMODEL_TESTDB_URL
JWT_SECRET
```
Also, a running MongoDB server or an AtlasDB instance also works.

### Note

This is just a side project, use at your own risk.
